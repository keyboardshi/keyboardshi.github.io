Aloha! We are Keyboards Hawaii, a local group of custom keyboard enthusiasts primarily gathered around the island of Oahu.

We currently don't have any meetups planned at this time. But you may come chat with the community over at Discord @[dsc.gg/hikb](https://dsc.gg/hikb) or check us out on Instagram [@keyboardshawaii](https://www.instagram.com/keyboardshawaii/).

## Future Meetups 

For the remainder of 2024, we are looking at one more meetup for our own annual (and usually largest!) winter-time meetup. Mahalo and hope to see you there!

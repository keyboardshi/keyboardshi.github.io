# Keyboards Hawaii 2024

<!-- ![](images/2024/) -->

Aloha! We are Keyboards Hawaii, a local group of custom keyboard enthusiasts primarily gathered around the island of Oahu.

We currently don't have any meetups planned at this time. But you may come chat with the community over at Discord @[dsc.gg/hikb](https://dsc.gg/hikb) or check us out on Instagram [@keyboardshawaii](https://www.instagram.com/keyboardshawaii/).

## Future Meetups 

For the remainder of 2024, we do hope to schedule two more meetups at most. One potentially in fall where we attend the 2024 Hawaii Geek Meet and lastly our own annual (and usually larger!) winter-time meetup. Mahalo and hope too see you there!

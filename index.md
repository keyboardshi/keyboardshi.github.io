Aloha! We are Keyboards Hawaii, a local group of custom keyboard enthusiasts primarily gathered around the island of Oahu. Below are the latest meetup details for this year. But aside from that, you can come chat with the community over at Discord @[dsc.gg/hikb](https://dsc.gg/hikb) or check us out on Instagram [@keyboardshawaii](https://www.instagram.com/keyboardshawaii/).

The wonderful people over at Keebs at UHM is hosting another event on Friday, August 30th. This time it will be in collaboration with their UHE and WoUHE Esports clubs!

Come help us show some support for them and show off some keyboards :) As a reminder - this event is NOT organized by Keyboards Hawaii, but it is open to the public.

Additional Notes:
- We are guests to the University of Hawaii, please treat the premises, attendees, keyboards, and organizers with respect
- There is a limited amount of space, so be prepared to reduce your keyboard displays for others if needed
- The UH Esports iLab can be found on Google Maps [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FJZZmWEojpo8JdH5A) 
- For parking information, please see [UH Commuter Services](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/commuter/visitors/) for more info
- Keep your hands clean and check for permission before handling the keyboards!

## Future Meetups 

For the remainder of 2024, we do hope to schedule two more meetups at most. One potentially in fall where we attend the 2024 Hawaii Geek Meet and lastly our own annual (and usually larger!) winter-time meetup. Mahalo and hope to see you there!

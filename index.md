It's that time of year again for our winter meetup! This year it will be on **Saturday, December 13th from 9:00 AM - 1 PM.**

We will be hosting the meetup in **Meeting Room B of the apartment complex at [801 South Street, Honolulu, HI 96813](https://www.google.com/maps/place/801+South+St,+Honolulu,+HI+96813/@21.3027265,-157.8570346,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7c006e0a3ec87477:0xf7e59aecfdbbc86a!8m2!3d21.3027265!4d-157.8563895!16s%2Fg%2F11c5n0qsfr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)**. For those who came out the past few winters, yes it's the same location.

**Please see below for details regarding the location and parking instructions.**

If this is your first keyboard meetup, welcome! This is just a friendly meetup to hang out, eat some snacks, and show off your mechanical keyboard collection amongst other enthusiasts and newbies of the keyboard hobby. No, you do not need to have a keyboard to attend... but we do like to bring food to these events (potluck style, but not required), so come out!

To stay up to date on any additional announcements, this page will be updated accordingly. All announcements will be cross posted within our Discord and on our Instagram page as well.

Mahalo and hope to see you there!


## Meetup Etiquette and Additional Notes
 
 - Check for permission before handling any keyboards on display! We unfortunately will not be providing index cards this year :(
 - Remember to keep your hands clean before touching any displays and refrain from eating/drinking near them.
 - This is NOT a for-profit event. Attendance is free to the public.
 - Any sales/purchases/trades are at your own risk and discretion. Keyboards Hawaii is not responsible for these transactions.
 - Lastly, we do not own the venue. Please treat the premises with respect and clean up after yourselves. The meeting room rental fees are at the expense of our organizers' pockets. Thank you for your cooperation!

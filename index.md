It's that time of year again for our winter meetup! This year it will be on **Saturday, November 30th from 8:30 AM - 2 PM.** (We are no longer starting at 8:00 AM to allow for setup time)

We will be hosting the meetup in **Meeting Room B of the apartment complex at [801 South Street, Honolulu, HI 96813](https://www.google.com/maps/place/801+South+St,+Honolulu,+HI+96813/@21.3027265,-157.8570346,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7c006e0a3ec87477:0xf7e59aecfdbbc86a!8m2!3d21.3027265!4d-157.8563895!16s%2Fg%2F11c5n0qsfr?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)**. For those who came out the past few winters, yes it's the same location.

**Please see below for details regarding the location and parking instructions.**

If this is your first keyboard meetup, welcome! This is just a friendly meetup to hang out, eat some snacks, and show off your mechanical keyboard collection amongst other enthusiasts and newbies of the keyboard hobby. No, you do not need to have a keyboard to attend... but we do like to bring food to these events (potluck style, but not required), so come out -- There will be giveaways too!

To stay up to date on any additional announcements, this page will be updated accordingly. All announcements will be cross posted within our Discord and on our Instagram page as well.

Thank you to our sponsors for their incredible generosity and providing our humble community with giveaways for the holidays this year.
